# Cybersecurity Piscine â€“ ft_onion

**Unleash the power of anonymity on the Internet.**

---

## Summary

**ft_onion** is a project in the Cybersecurity Piscine that focuses on setting up a hidden service on the Tor network. The goal is to configure a web server that hosts a static webpage accessible via a `.onion` URL. This project emphasizes networking, web server configuration, and leveraging anonymity for secure communication.

## Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Static Web Page**:
   - Serve a single `index.html` file as the webpage content.
   - Accessible via a `.onion` URL on the Tor network.

2. **Nginx Web Server**:
   - Configured to serve the static webpage.
   - HTTP access enabled on port 80.

3. **SSH Access**:
   - Configure SSH to allow access on port 4242 via the Tor network.

4. **No Extra Ports**:
   - No additional ports are opened, and no firewall rules are set.

## Usage

### Setting Up the Services

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```
   
## Start the Services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Restart or Stop the Services:

### Stop:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Restart:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing the Setup
### Tor Hidden Service
To retrieve the .onion URL for your service:

```
docker exec -it ft_onion-tor-1 cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname
```

Copy the .onion URL and open it in a Tor-enabled browser (e.g., Tor Browser).

## SSH Service
To test SSH access via the Tor network:

```
ssh -v -p 4242 \
    -o ProxyCommand="nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:9150 %h %p" \
    -o "ServerAliveInterval 60" joeberle@<onion_address>
Password: joeberle
```
